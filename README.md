# NGX Angular Loading

It is a library to makes loading screens easier in Angular (2+)

## Credits

This project was seeded by [https://github.com/darthwade/angular-loading](https://github.com/darthwade/angular-loading) because the author was not responding to pull requests so decided to take what they had started and update and run with it. Along the way we put some of our own opinions on it and added some tests, enough changes that it stopped being a viable PR for the original without serious breaking changes.


## Installation
```npm
npm install ngx-angular-loading
```
